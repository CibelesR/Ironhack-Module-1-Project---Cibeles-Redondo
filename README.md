# Ironhack-Module-1-Project---Cibeles-Redondo

As part of Ironhack part-time Bootcamp, this project will show the knowledge and technical skills I have developed in this first module.

## Project Description
In this project, I will work with a Kaggle database about Forbes top billionaires. The objective of the project is to clean, transform and merge the dataset info to make it available for further analysis.


## Project Goals
- Reading the selecting data
- Analyzing a first step action for new information
- Create a new repository in GitHub
- Merge 3 different data sources
- Finding duplicates
- Finding nulls
- Analyzing 'Unnamed:0' column
- Transform 'Source' column into 'Company' and 'Source_type' splitting for the arrow
- Changing 'Worth' column from billions to millions and unify. Cleaning text inside.
- Unify 'Worth' with 'worthChange'
- Delete 'realTimeWorth' because it is not going to be used in further analysis
- Transform to capital letters the 'LastName' column
- Transform 'age' column. Some of the information is the years of born but other information is the age indeed.
- Rename nulls for unification (for example 'Country' column has different null definitions)
- Rename 'Country' values to make the same countries match
- 'Gender' column unification
- Checking points or commas for numbers


## Results
Because of lack of time I was not able to complete other important parts of the Module 1 Project. A pipeline with other code was made to learn about this point of the project. Also, the data cleaning effort and time are not adequate. I must stop earlier and start with other parts of the project.
This project allows me to build confidence with Pandas library
